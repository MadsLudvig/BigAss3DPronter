# Material Supply System


Here as said in the introduction a mini vacuum conveyer will be mounted on the extruder. Its material line, will then be run through the cable carrier and down to a material dryer which will be drying the material, so it has minimal moisture for fine prints. The mini vacuum conveyer in question is here the Conradt by Andertech as seen in this attachment: [CONRADT.pdf](md_attachments/CONRADT.pdf). The dryer in question is not found yet. The heating elements of the extruder will be powered by some sort of heat control elements. Preferably ones that can be controlled by software, so the temp can be controlled in the octoprint interface. But if this is out of the budget or simply not possible, conventional heat control elements will be used.
